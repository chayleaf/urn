# URN

A Rust crate for handling
[URNs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8141). Parsing
and comparison is done according to the spec (meaning only part of the
URN is used for equality checks). Some RFCs define per-namespace lexical
equivalence rules, those aren't taken into account here. RFC2141 is more
lenient than RFC8141 at times (and vice versa), care is taken to be able
to parse (and encode) either of them. Serde support is available behind
a feature flag. `no_std` support is available if you disable the default
"std" feature. `alloc` is optional as well. `UrnSlice` is a borrowed
URN, `Urn` is an owned URN. See [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/urn) for
documentation.

URNs have a surprising amount of obscure details to the point I'm not
sure if other URN parsers can be trusted! Granted, there's very little
of them because almost nobody really needs URNs...
